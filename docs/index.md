# ‚ùì What is Relay for Revit?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6782c5e9-8cf2-4cc1-8daf-a120c97688c2)

Relay is a plugin for Revit developed by [john pierson](johntpierson.com). Relay allows you to add Dynamo graphs (.dyn files) to your ribbon as push button tools.
This is achieved by launching Dynamo in the background (UI-Less) and running the given Dynamo graph. This requires you to have only one version of Dynamo installed and for your Dynamo Graph to be structured in a way that allows you not to require inputs or use custom nodes to feed inputs. More info here: [Working With Inputs](#-working-with-inputs)

# üÜò Support
## üíª General Support:
This code is provided "As-Is" and without warranty. The idea was to expose how to do this within Revit, while developing a tool for our own internal uses. If you encounter anything that you want to report, please do that on the Github Issues page, 

> üí° note: there are no guarantees regarding development based on the posted issues

# ‚èØ Usage
## üîß Installation:

Preferred Installation Path: ```C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\202x```

| -        | -          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| For a simple install, simply unzip the folder from releases, to the above directory. Your folder structure should resemble the GIF to the right if you did it correctly.           | ![relayInstall](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29fc3e9a-f910-4dff-8e98-089fc9a7f9bc) |



[These instructions](https://github.com/radumg/DynaWeb#alternative-installation-methods) from Radu, describe the process for unzipping folders for Revit add-ins.

| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66ce17d9-a548-40ff-91b6-dd9742b52e30) | Relay.addin ‚Üí This loads the tool into your version of Revit and references the .dll in the Relay folder. |
| - | Relay.dll ‚Üí The code that actually loads and runs the tool.   |
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1756ad8-1f29-4ce5-9958-9a652daaae99) | Relay Folder ‚Üí Contains the .dll file and the Dynamo graph folder structure.      |

> üí° The above would be the minimum to get started. Below we break down the graph folder structure in more detail.

# üèó Dynamo Graph Structure:
_How to structure your folder for success._

- Relay Graphs - The main directory that the plugin looks at.
  - SubFolder 1 - Creates a panel in Revit with this folder name.
    - Folder1DynamoGraph1.dyn - Unique Dynamo graph name.
    -  Folder1DynamoGraph1_16.png - (optional) 16x16 px image for small images.
    - Folder1DynamoGraph1_32.png - (optional) 32x32 px image for small images.
  - SubFolder 2 - Creates a panel in Revit with this folder name.
    - Folder2DynamoGraph1.dyn - *Unique Dynamo graph name.*
    - Folder2DynamoGraph1_16.png - *(optional)* *16x16 px image for small images.*
    - Folder2DynamoGraph1_32.png - *(optional)* 32*x32 px image for small images.*
    - Folder2DynamoGraph2.dyn - *Unique Dynamo graph name.*
    - Folder2DynamoGraph2_16.png - *(optional)* *16x16 px image for small images.*
    - Folder2DynamoGraph2_32.png - *(optional)* 32*x32 px image for small images.*

# üèÜ Best Practices for Graphs
## üîå Working with Inputs:
As you may imagine, what good is a Dynamo graph without being able to interact with it? Dynamo player manages this in its own way, but Relay relies on this interaction being designed by the original Graph author. If you do not build inputs into your graphs with [Data-Shapes](https://data-shapes.io/) or something similar, then your graph will use whatever was selected last.

### Selecting Model Elements:
Using Data-Shapes for selection.

# üì¶ Managing Packages:
By design, Relay requires your users to have all Packages installed that you use within your Dynamo graphs. This tool does not manage package dependencies for you in any way. If a user runs one of your Dynamo graphs that uses a package and they do not have it, **it simply will not run to completion**.

If managing packages on the fly with Dynamo graphs on the ribbon is a requirement for you. You should definitely check out, [Orkestra from Data-Shapes.io](https://www.orkestra.online/).
